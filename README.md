# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Application

My project involves developing a heart disease prediction model using five different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. The goal is to use clinical parameters to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

To develop the model, I will start by collecting a dataset containing information on patients' clinical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant indicators. Then, I will preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and ready for use in machine learning algorithms.

Next, I will use the five different algorithms to train and test the model using the collected data. During this process, I will evaluate each algorithm's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine which algorithm performs the best.

Once I have determined the best-performing algorithm, I will fine-tune it using hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve its accuracy and predictive power. The final model will be deployed and made available for healthcare professionals to use to predict a patient's likelihood of having heart disease.

The project's objective is to create an accurate and reliable heart disease prediction model that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating heart disease at an early stage, potentially improving patient outcomes.
